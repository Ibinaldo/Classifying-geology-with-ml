# Facies classification using machine learning
This project demonstrates how K-means clustering can be applied to petrophysical data. This can speed up processing times in terms of supervised classification of rock units, and can provide quick insights into the geological structure of a given area. This is very useful in oil and gas exploration

## Notebooks included
1. `Converting LAS file data to CSV format`: This code takes **LAS** files and converts them into CSV format
2. `Combine CSV files`: This code combines several **CSV** files with the same header into a single file
3. `Facies Classification`: This code demonstrates the application of K-means clustering to petrophysical data and interpretation of the geology


## Files provided
* LAS files for some oil wells
* CSV files containing well and formation information
